## Prologue
Welcome to this introductory course on the Python programming language.

The lessons are described in [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/index.html). As outlined in the pre-requisites section, you should have jupyter installed on your laptop (If you have used the anaconda distribution of python, then it already includes jupyter). You can then change to this directory and type : `jupyter notebook`

This will open a browser and you can then browse through the lessons. It would help immensely if you spend 5 to 10 minutes and familiarize yourself with jupyter. Here is a handy [cheatsheet](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/pdf_bw/).
